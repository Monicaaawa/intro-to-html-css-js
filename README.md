# HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design websites. It provides a way to structure content and add text, images, videos, links, and other multimedia elements to web pages, and is a crucial foundation for web development.

## Getting Started
To start learning HTML, you will need a text editor and a web browser. You can use any text editor you are comfortable with, such as Notepad, TextEdit, or Sublime Text. For testing your HTML pages, you can use any web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

## Creating a HTML Page
To create an HTML page, you need to follow a few basic steps:

1. Open your text editor and create a new file.
2. Save the file with an .html extension (e.g., index.html).
3. Add the basic structure of an HTML page, which includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
4. Add the content to your page using tags such as `<h1>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<img>` for images, and `<a>` for links.
5. Save your file and open it in a web browser to view the page.
